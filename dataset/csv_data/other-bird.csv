At 5:30 it stretched and preened and flew off deeper into the woods, at which time I ceased birding.   Throughout the day, many people stopped to observe the bird.

I beached the kayak and the bird continued coming up, approaching to approximately 60 feet away.  The bird then walked to the west side of the island.  I watched it from various sides of the island.  At 930, it flew to the next island to the east.  I watched it there for another 30-40 minutes, at which point it flew east onto the eastern shore.  I left at that point.    Medium-large, long-legged wader, somewhere between the size of a Snowy Egret and a Great Blue Heron.  Generally brown overall with white streaking through wings with increasing amounts of white on the neck.  Long bill that is predominantly yellow on the proximal half and fading into a dark/black distal third of the bill.    I observed the bird eating several mussels.  A couple of times it picked up some jelly-like collections.  It wasn't clear if it ate these.  Perhaps bryozoans which were quite common in the area?  At one point, it was being harassed by a Louisiana Waterthrush--had to laugh at the waterthrush singing its heart out and the Limpkin couldn't have cared less.  Coordinates of first location:  39.084485, -86.330605 Bird went to the north point of the island and ended up here: 39.086031, -86.330874 It then flew to the next island to the east (at the time I was here, it as about 50-75 yards long, distinctly separated from the much larger island immediately south--it appears to potentially be connected in the satellite maps): 39.085827, -86.330214 It then flew over to the eastern shore roughly here: 39.085827, -86.329629",Aramus guarauna,limpki,Species,5642,,5.00,110,,3243,4864

One flock on the far side of the valley contained 31 individuals, counted individually as they flew from one grove of pines to another. Didn't detect any Audubon's in this flock either audibly or visually. A few more scattered pairs or small flocks between there and the road, and then a flock of 15+ (likely the same flock we had first thing in the morning), this one containing at least a couple Audubon's, but still almost entirely Goldman's.

Possibly a definitive male considering the lack of any black around the head and crisp grey tips to the jet black primaries and secondaries.  Wandering up the rocky bit to the west of the entrance to try get looks at the Rock Nuthatch trio that Sam enjoyed earlier while I was following the pair, I was ecstatic to suddenly find myself face-to-face with this legendary passerine no more than 15 m away, it's pale grey upperparts contrasting with the darker rocks. Getting bins on the bird, I'd watch as it flicked it's wings every so often revealing a flash of brilliant carmine pink then probe its thin decurved bill into crevices before fluttering around like a butterfly to a new perch.  Realising the direction it was moving, I quickly positioned myself ahead of the bird scrambling a little up the scree in the hope that it would come right towards me and it did exactly that with the bird down to just a few metres from me minding its own business. Despite supposedly only 18g, the bird seemed bigger than a nuthatch maybe that was just the wings? I also got a full appreciation of its spectacular feet! Typical toe arrangement, three in front and one behind as a treecreeper, but everything bigger! Big feet and long curved claws that looked almost comically long. After a fantastic five minutes (although it felt more like an hour) the bird worked it's way above my head and over a small overhang where I could no longer see it. I dared not to move in case of flushing it and with Sam now heading over there's a good chance he could see it from lower down which he did.   Shortly after, the Wallcreeper took a longer flight 50 m east towards the main part of the quarry where we lost the bird to view. I then relocated it a little bit later and enjoyed more fantastic looks through bins over 10 minutes before it headed back towards where I initially found it.  I'm told that Wallcreepers can often be distant, with it being a small bird on a vast rock face so I really couldn't have asked for more for my first encounter!",Tichodroma muraria,wallcr1,Species,26427,,4.96,141,,1525,2711

Originally, found on a CBC on 12/31/2022; first spotted by Joe Melony and reported by Jonathan Heller. I went and saw the bird on January 2, a lifer then. Apparently, the bird continued for a long time, last being seen sometime around the end of March. Now, on 10/23/2023, the bird was spotted at the nearby Washington Boro Park by Stanley C. Stahl, who then recorded it the following day back at the water treatment plant. From what I've observed, the bird has been a lot more hit or miss than it was last winter. Since I was in the area, I decided I'd stop by for a couple minutes to hopefully get a glimpse of the bird flycatching around the hypochlorite tanks as it did last winter.  What I didn't expect was to pull up to the fence, look down at my phone to record my start time, then look back up to see the phoebe bound through the air and land directly in front of my car. Got to watch it very close up for a minute or so, but didn't get pictures because if I'd moved I would've scared it. But how amazing to see this western bird right in front of me in Pennsylvania!  Eventually it flew off but I decided to position myself better and wait for another opportunity for pictures this time. It took almost two hours, the bird mostly flying around the tanks and the roof of the nearby building, and several times frustratingly farther down the fence, but finally it flew back in to the fence where I was waiting and posed gorgeously. So happy to get a picture I'm happy with of this rare species!!",Sayornis saya,saypho,Species,16699,,4.97,111,,,

When I arrived it had not been seen in a little while, but was soon detected in trees to the south with its sharp chip, then seen foraging somewhat high. Flew over our heads to the north end of the long patch of shrubs and worked its way back south as it does, staying low and hopping on the ground in front of everyone. Despite its obliging nature, some felt the need to crowd it even though it followed the same path every time and would eventually make its way over to you. Throughout the entire time I was there, if it wasn’t foraging in the trees or phragmites, my best looks came from sitting on the ground  and waiting for the bird to make its way over to me. At several points, it flew right over my head, and even snagged a morsel from between my legs once. Just an incredible encounter, even if it was soured by the bad behavior of some. Whenever rare birds are found, I feel a bit of a conflict between being excited to see something new I may never get the chance to see again (or at least for this one, never off of the breeding grounds) and being worried that the bird may not be able to find its way back to where it needs to be.

I spent from 11:40am to 5:30pm with this bird today. It ate 4 snakes: 1 huge one, and 3 smaller ones. It was 4/7 in hunting tries (4 successes, 3 tries came up empty handed). It was mostly hunting from 11:40 to around 4pm, and then napped from around 4pm to 5:30pm. At 5:30 it stretched and preened and flew off deeper into the woods, at which time I ceased birding.   Throughout the day, many people stopped to observe the bird. This owl is chill as hell and seems to be very used to human presence. I think it uses the bike path traffic as a way to find prey that gets stirred up.

Afterwards, bird was seen several times well down the creek in the hackberries gorging on berries (32.1102795, -104.4630678). I had the best luck seeing this bird by sitting down and sitting very still along the path, looking towards the Russian olives. The Mockingbird would regularly follow a pair of Gray Catbirds from the olives to the hackberries and at one point was directly above me in the Hackberry eating unbothered. The bird was larger than the nearby Gray Catbirds with a distinctive long dark tail and thin long bill. Photos and recordings taken.",Melanotis caerulescens,blumoc,Species,27534,,4.88,195,,1800,3054

Small pale bills, showing moderate amount of duskiness esp near the tip.with one individual showing a minor, partial ring around the eye   Mostly clean white throats with a nominal amount of dark feathering on the ""chin"".  Used a distinct chirping call to signal a dive and whenever one was separated from the other two, would vocalize with a stronger, sharper warbler/Phoebe type call until they were united again.  Much better light than the other day and more sustained views revealing addl. detail, such as a fleck of white feathers on the head of one and the appearance of a possible right eye issue with the new individual (in some photos, it looks normal but in others it looks inflamed so I can't say for sure what is happening, if anything, with the eye)",Synthliboramphus antiquus,ancmur,Species,6393,,4.95,86,,5464,8192

The Ross's Gull was offshore sitting on the water, just beyond the breaking waves when we arrived. After a few minutes it lifted off, and flew directly toward the pack of assembled birders, coming within feet of us before crossing the road and dropping down into the Surfer's Parking Lot on the east side of Highway 1. I stayed in this lot foraging for about 15 minutes, before being bumped by dog walkers and cars. It foraged along the roadside of the road to the east of this parking lot for a while, flushing each time a car passed and nearly getting hit several times. It then flew back across Highway 1 and ended up in the park about 500 yards south of here. It foraged on the grassy lawn and along the walkways of that park till near dark, when it headed out to sea. Overall spectacular views of an other-worldly bird. My only fear is that if it keeps up this foraging behavior, it's only a matter of time before it gets hit by a dog, or captured by a feral cat (many lurking around the harbor area).",Rhodostethia rosea,rosgul,Species,6408,,4.83,211,,1500,2500

Spotted in one of first flocks of morning by Jeremiah Trimble, on water near Cory’s and Great Shearwaters. On first sight, notable characteristics were small size (similar to Great), dark-headed appearance, and thin dusky bill—quite different from other Calonectris taxa (Cory’s/Scopoli’s). Took off and flew right in front of boat, showing same characteristics in flight as well dark underside of primaries, long thin wings, long tail, and flight style more similar to Great Shearwater: snappier wingbeats and less ponderous flight than Cory’s. Flew off to east and lost among other Shearwater groups, despite our attempts to chase. Not seen again during 5 more hours in the area looking through the thousands of birds. Previous accepted record is from 15 August 2004 in North Carolina—an additional previous report off of Maryland in 2006 has since been determined to not be this species. Three other potential reports off of North Carolina (2013) and Florida and Massachusetts (2021).  (NB note: CVSH coordinates 41.670066, -69.860951.

Continuing juvenile foraging cooperatively along north side of westbound land east of marina. As reported, surprisingly obliging. Foraging actively and in the open almost the entire time I was there, moving slowly and stealthily through the grass and along the edge of the bushes. At least five successful predation events, mostly of large earthworms but at least one small orthopteran. A couple of times the bird jumped and ran back into the bushes, seemingly startled by whatever it was attempting to pull out of the ground. Otherwise unafraid of even the loudest passing trucks and motorcycles, and completely oblivious to the crowd of birders on the other side of the highway. Often closed a bluish eyelid (nictitating membrane?) as it was foraging, and many photos show this, although it often appears more like a reflection on the eye and not as strikingly pale bluish as it did in the field. With short, thick bill and buff pattern on upperparts, the bird appeared much more like a galliform or buttonquail than a rallid.  Reported deceased the next morning (9 November 2017), apparently the victim of a vehicle strike. Taken to AMNH where it was prepared the same day and shown to be a male (with testes 5x2.5 mm) and weighing 110g .",Crex crex,corcra,Species,5296,,4.89,83,,2263,3823

A pale medium-sized bird was perched atop a stick in a field, which I hoped wouldn’t be a mockingbird. It had a yellow belly, blue-gray head, a greenish back, and a thick bill. Other yellow-bellied kingbirds were ruled out due to the relatively smaller bill, gray of throat running down onto the breast, and prominent white outer vanes of the outer rectrices.   This seems like a particularly good year for Western Kingbirds in the east, as well as Tropical Kingbirds. It’s unclear if those two things are related since we aren’t confident in the source population of Tropical Kingbirds. This is the 7th record in Mass so far this fall, with others coming from Wachusett, Halifax, Wellfleet, Chatham, two from Cuttyhunk, and Manomet. New York has had eight records already, and Maine has had one.  The lack of emargination in p9-10 indicates a hatch year. A molt limit is apparent in the greater and lesser coverts in the spread-wing photo.  The exact location of the bird is in Rampart’s Field- https://goo.gl/maps/Aabv5n3JctBK1vav6. This field can be accessed by parking at the Eastern Point Lighthouse and walking the trail across the street from the Yacht Club. It was moving all throughout the northwest side of the field (sunlit in early morning) and in the cedar trees in the field. Sometimes it would sit and preen in a thicket or high up in a deciduous tree.",Tyrannus verticalis,weskin,Species,17152,,4.98,50,,1999,2998

Tail was often held slightly cocked upwards and occasionally flicked in a diagonal movement. Plumage a rather pleasing set of yellows and peaches, with the yellow being most concentrated around the head and the upper sides of the breast, eventually fading slightly towards the flanks and gradually mixing with a peachy-tan color. This peach color also extended onto some of the undertail coverts.

At least three, likely more. All foraging in the vegetation near the metal platform, at one point two chasing one another. One appeared to be an adult male, another a SY male, and a third bird was a female/immature that I didn't see well. I think there was an additional juvenile that flew briefly across my line of sight in an open window in the vegetation. At one point I watched a single bird near the base of the platform catch two minnows. Pretty amazing views of at that same bird out in the open.  Bird photographed is aged as a SY male due to retained juvenile coverts.",Ixobrychus exilis,leabit,Species,7340,,4.94,54,,3534,5741

I was sitting down listening and looking for SNBU when Chris DiPiazza came in and immediately started photographing something on the opposite side of the pier. That something turned out to be a PUSA, which had taken advantage of the very low tide to forage on the rocks that are usually covered by water. Started out slightly shy but became incredibly confiding as they tend to be, coming within three feet of me at times. Was still around when I finally tore myself away at 1:30. I wonder when it flew in... I was at the pier by 7:50 and it definitely wasn't around then, and a fair number of birders came by in between then and when it first was spotted.

Lightly marked coburni and heavily marked iliacus can both show half-blurry markings on off-white upper breast and flanks, but the bird’s legs and undertail coverts might tip the scale, as they are important for distinguishing ambiguous individuals like this. The anterior tarsal scale is brown-tinged pink, the posterior scale is brown, and the scutate phalangeal scales are dusky brown. The UTCs are heavily marked by brown sides on each feather, but this isn’t immediately apparent as the undertail is rarely in full view*.  A case can be made for nominate race simply because this isn’t a slam-dunk coburni, but there is a fair number of similar birds breeding in Iceland, assuming that those are all coburni (see https://ebird.org/checklist/S47146029 and https://ebird.org/checklist/S45871808 and https://ebird.org/checklist/S58080572). I’d even say that this bird has darker feet and more heavily marked UTCs than many confirmed coburni birds, including the ones labeled ‘Icelandic’ on the redwing’s eBird species profile.  This observation was made on a clear, sunny day. Direct sunlight makes the upperparts look deceptively pale, and the buffy margins to the underpart markings are easily washed out (probably rarely happens in its typical breeding and wintering ranges, just guessing). But even with lighting accounted for, I really can’t tell if the overall colors favor iliacus or coburni.  While the plumage falls within variation of both subspecies, I have yet to find any photos of nominate birds whose feet are anywhere near this dark. I’m calling it a coburni for now. However, seeing that the NH bird from 2016 was determined to be iliacus, I’d be happy to correct this ID if/when the experts announce a different verdict!  *See this shot by L. Robinson’s for a more direct - but still partially obscured - view of the UTC markings: https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/302428501#_ga=2.119478217.1954771596.1605789642-1531498591.1603228104",Turdus iliacus,redwin1,Group,27982,,4.88,74,"",3194,4791

We lost it fairly quickly and could not refind it until awhile later when it almost flew right over us both on Kirkpatrick St. near building T1044. We followed it to the roped off section near the volleyball court here (37.8326834, -122.5347095), where we eventually enjoyed great views as it foraged actively. We were soon joined by others, who all had solid looks at the bird in the same general vicinity.   Superficially, reminiscent of an empid (WIFL), but overall larger, darker uppers, dark head/crown and face, dark tail, and all black bill. Phoebe-type behavior, constantly tail-wagging. A really good bird for the county, the first since 2017 and the first chaseable one in over a decade(?). Enjoyed an absolutely lovely Marin Phoebe trifecta.",Sayornis phoebe,easpho,Species,16697,,5.00,42,,1951,2927

I first found the bird at the pin for this list at 810AM.  The bird was generally moving northward along the island on the west side of the north-south channel.  I beached the kayak and the bird continued coming up, approaching to approximately 60 feet away.  The bird then walked to the west side of the island.  I watched it from various sides of the island.  At 930, it flew to the next island to the east.  I watched it there for another 30-40 minutes, at which point it flew east onto the eastern shore.  I left at that point.    Medium-large, long-legged wader, somewhere between the size of a Snowy Egret and a Great Blue Heron.  Generally brown overall with white streaking through wings with increasing amounts of white on the neck.  Long bill that is predominantly yellow on the proximal half and fading into a dark/black distal third of the bill.    I observed the bird eating several mussels.  A couple of times it picked up some jelly-like collections.  It wasn't clear if it ate these.  Perhaps bryozoans which were quite common in the area?  At one point, it was being harassed by a Louisiana Waterthrush--had to laugh at the waterthrush singing its heart out and the Limpkin couldn't have cared less.  Coordinates of first location:  39.084485, -86.330605 Bird went to the north point of the island and ended up here: 39.086031, -86.330874 It then flew to the next island to the east (at the time I was here, it as about 50-75 yards long, distinctly separated from the much larger island immediately south--it appears to potentially be connected in the satellite maps): 39.085827, -86.330214 It then flew over to the eastern shore roughly here: 39.085827, -86.329629",Aramus guarauna,limpki,Species,5642,,4.90,61,,2585,3877

Presumably same individual found in Nova Scotia this summer.   Originally observed at base of Whale Point, where upon rounding the corner from the Slough I was immediately able to get on the bird, which was wading in shallow water just before Souza pier. Struck me as a miniature Great Blue Heron until closer inspection in scope, which revealed an incredibly pallid and white bird with no hints of rufous anywhere.   I thought momentarily then about the possibility of Gray Heron, before Mark Souza pulled up behind me to talk about a missing pineapple pool floaty that had drifted out towards Whale Point. I tried not to be rude by turning my back and photographing the bird some more, but by the time I could look again at where the bird was, some beachgoers were walking towards us, and had flushed the bird in my direction. I quickly got some flight shots, and this concluded my brief encounter with the bird.   Later, once I got back to the field station, I was able to upload the pictures to my computer and realized then that there was a very good chance that my bird had been a Gray Heron. I immediately reached out to RRV, who supported the proposal, and then proceeded to send pictures to Jeremiah Trimble. He, in turn, provided me with the below picture showing the similarities between my bird and the Nova Scotia bird, credits to Tom Johnson.   Identification based off of overall structure, being a strikingly small bird with short foot projection in flight, and a proportionally shorter bill. Pencil-thin streaking on dull-white breast and reduced colour on sides of throat immediately pointed towards Gray in the field. No rufous tones anywhere. Bold, contrasting black bar noted on ventral area, bordered by pure white thigh feathers.   ***Tuckernuck Island is private property and requires explicit permission from a landowner to access. It should be discouraged to chase this bird, except from boat at Whale Point.***",Ardea cinerea,graher1,Species,7507,,4.83,92,,3060,4590

At first they seemed a little weary but after 20 minutes or so they seemed to not mind my presence in the slightest, often approaching within the minimum focusing distance of my camera. Behaviorally these birds were far different than any other passerine I have seen. They were observed diving, swimming and wading in the fast flowing water. On two separate occasions I observed one of the birds perching above the water on a rock or branch then diving into the water similarly to a Kingfisher.  These birds were indistinctly marked grayish passerines that appeared plump overall with very short tails. The heads appeared slightly more brownish than the rest of the body. The birds also had  somewhat indistinct eye-lines that were most prominent behind the eye. One very striking feature that was not easily seen on the birds where the completely white eyelids. When the birds would “dip” they would often close their eyes display this feature. Although even when the eyes were open a small patch of white was often still visible above the eye. The bills were overall black and relatively straight, becoming slightly more tapered towards the tip and were about 2/3 the length of the head. The birds were overall a slate gray or sooty gray color becoming slightly more bluish or almost purplish depending on the light towards the back and the wings. The upper breasts were slightly more brownish than the rest of the body, especially toward the neck. The wings overall seemed very short and pointed and were indistinctly marked, although some the flight feathers were slightly darker than the rest of the body and were edged in white. The tail was very short and stumpy, seeming very reminiscent of something like a Pacific Wren. The tail was also held in a similar very cocked position. The legs were overall very long and very light pinkish overall. The feet seemed very large for a passerine. On several occasions the birds were heard giving their distinct rattling flight call, a fast high pitched trill that usually lasted only a second or so. I was unable to record this due to stream noise.",Cinclus mexicanus,amedip,Species,27214,,4.77,177,,2048,3000

Continuing bird, found by Chad Crouch on the 24th and reported on the 28th. Refound this morning by Mark Selle. Liam first saw the bird at 11:35 flying overhead at the east end of the island. A few minutes later, I relocated the bird by its chip calls from a nearby conifer. A few seconds later we got visual of the bird and confirmed it was the warbler in question. 5 of us watched the bird for over an hour after the initial sighting as it worked through the trees at the east end of the park with kinglets, sometimes coming down into the open at eye level, giving phenomenal views.   An overall large looking Setophaga. Small all black warbler bill, with faded black eye stripe running from the bill to the back of the cheek. Faint pale olive tinged yellow  green cheek patch contrasting with bright yellow eyebrow and border to the underside of the cheek. Lemon yellow eye arcs we're visible at close range as well. The crown and back were the same color, a slightly darker shade of the yellow green then on the cheek. Back showed some faint gray black streaking/checkering, but still well within BTNW range in my opinion, not enough to make it a hybrid. Pale gray wings with two thin white wingbars. Also a bit of yellow feathers on the upper wing above the first wingbar which seems pretty normal for BTNW. Rump a yellow green color, no streaking. Underside and throat was a creamy white, with a bit of black/gray feathering coming in on the sides of the neck and throat. Clean gray streaks running down the sides to the vent, thickest closer to the neck. Vent area the same creamy white as the underparts. Underside of the tail showed a pattern of white with gray edging, and fanned tail in flight showed a gray tail with three to four white outer tail feathers, classic of Setophagas. Wing undersides a plain gray, whiter near the body. Called every couple minutes, a YRWA like chip note, a bit flatter and more watery then YRWA. ",Setophaga virens,btnwar,Species,33675,,4.84,87,,2807,4492

The bird was sitting on the water and preening, giving an odd overall impression (to the naked eye, it would have been easy to dismiss as a black and white buoy). I took a photo of it and zoomed way in on it on the back of my camera to get a better look. I showed Jeff the photo and he immediately pegged it as a Yellow-nosed Albatross. We conferred for a brief moment, then I ran into the cabin and showed the photo to the captain and naturalist, who quickly agreed to turn the boat around. We got back on the bird shortly after turning around and everyone on board got amazing views. After a minute or two, the bird lazily took flight and circled around the boat before landing again a short distance away. A few more minutes later, the bird did this once more. When everyone had filled their memory cards, we left the bird sitting on the water and continued with the trip.

I honestly thought it was a juvie Ruffed Grouse, partly because I simply could not figure it out. Ian called it out as a woodcock which suddenly snapped me back to reality. We easily found the two chicks while the presumed female gave wing flopping broken wing displays on the ground and effectively lured us out in the bogs, only to return to the chicks when we weren't looking. She eventually got the chicks to safety and would flush more easily to lead us away from them.

SS and AY were able to relocate the bird at 22:05 in the same general area as found previously. The bird was 2.43 miles (3.91 km) from Gas Well Road   When we first arrived, we fanned out to cover more ground as the prospects of relocating the bird seem slim. After not much more than 5 minutes of searching AY noticed a small, atypical passerine perched on a small tundra rise. SS was able to get on the bird almost immediately, and we quickly realized we had managed to relocate it. After our celebratory moment of elation, we realized we had lost the bird, but quickly found it again 15m away.   The bird was quite active, hopping and walking through the tundra tussocks and clumps of grass, readily picking insects off of the leeward side of the vegetation. Occasionally, it would pick up and fly to a new hummock 10-20m away and resume active foraging. Its high level of activity meant it was easy to follow as it moved about, and we rarely lost sight of it for more than a few minutes. After spending half an hour with the bird, we decided to move on, with the bird still remaining in the same general area as we originally found it.   Description:  The bird was a smallish passerine, whose shape was somewhat reminiscent of a North American wood warbler. The sharp contrast between clean white underparts and the gray and brown upperparts immediately ruled out all regularly occurring North Slope passerines and most North American vagrants. This bird had a small dark bill that was fairly robust and blunt, proportionally similar to a Yellow-rumped Warbler, not fine-tipped like a Cape May Warbler. The bird sported a slate-gray cap that starkly contrasted the pure white throat just below the eye. There was a small, slightly darker gray-black patch just behind and below the eyes. The white throat wrapped below and around the auriculars towards the nape, before fading out, forming a white spur shape. The dusky cap faded into the grayish-brown back and lesser and median coverts. The primaries were a darker shade of brown, compared to the gray-brown back. The wings and coverts were unmarked and lacked wingbars or any contrasting colors. The white throat faded into the pale-grayish underparts in the upper breast area. The underparts were entirely clean and unstreaked. The tail was relatively long and gray-brown, a similar shade to the upper back with white-edged outer rects. The legs were black.",Curruca curruca,leswhi4,Species,24880,,4.94,49,,1797,2696

Almost certainly one of the same individuals as in the other photos.,"I spent ca. 40 minutes watching a pair of Dusky Tetrakas foraging along the river edge around 150 east (downstream) of our camp at Antegnarano (located at the intersection of the two streams visible on satellite images).   I was first alerted to tetrakas when they started alarm calling in response to a ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans) that was walking along the water's edge. The tetrakas stayed low to the ground (going to a maximum of around 2m above the ground) and within about 10m of the edge of the water. The moved quickly around in the understory. I described them as ""hyperactive"" in my notes for the day. These birds were about 100m upriver from where I encountered the pair yesterday and I imagine were likely the same individuals. They eventually flew across the river (or large stream depending on how you look at it) and I lost them in thick undergrowth on the opposite bank as they headed downstream in the direction of yesterday's sighting.   I had anticipated that this species would be difficult to separate from Spectacled Tetraka but when I saw these birds in the field several things were immediately obvious: 1) Different behavior. Dusky always stayed close to or on the ground in the gloomy understory rather than in the mid-story. I even observed one go into a small cave under a rock to look for food. This semi-terrestrial foraging reminded me a bit of a Troglodytes wren in terms of behavior. 2) Different shape. Notably short tail and long strong legs. Also surprisingly obvious was the relatively large eye when compared to Spectacled Tetraka. 3) Darker overall plumage, particularly on the upperparts and breastband which contrasted sharply with the bright yellow throat, eyering and surprisingly bright orangey-colored bill. In the dark understory the yellow throat, broken eyering and bill really stood out. 4) Different vocalizations. I only heard the Duskys make one type of call. A series of high-pitched notes which they repeated often (see attached recording).   Following this observation we set mist-nets at this location and netted one individual a couple of hours later (photos included).  In collaboration with Lily-Arison Rene de Roland, Loukman Kalavah and the Peregrine Fund's Madagascar program as part of the Search for Lost Birds.",Xanthomixis tenebrosa,dustet1,Species,23562,,4.80,107,In-hand,5896,3931

In view by other birders when we showed up (Casey Ryan, Dessi Sieburth, Logan Kahle, Ethan Monk,  Frank Fabro).   Our first experience with it was when it was foraging in the small cove with a few other GRYEs here: 41.842053, -124.202895. It then flew over to the opposite side of The Narrows here: 41.841314, -124.204980 and would also occasionally fly to the small island bar around here: 41.840448, -124.207384 and then back to the original location. Bird was extremely active and was seen to successfully catch multiple small fish.   In comparison to Greater Yellowlegs it regularly associated with it was similar in size but obviously whiter below. In flight it had that obvious white wedge going far up the back, farther than a dowitcher wedge, and it's tail looked wholly bright white in a distance (but clearly barred in close looks and photos), giving the overall impression of much paler tringa. In close viewing the bird also looked paler overall than GRYEs and was noticeably different from the white line that started at the chin/throat and continued down into the very white belly. The sides of the breast were similar to GRYE barring. It was super cool to see that it had a diffuse white stripe on both sides of the neck that continued down to the base of the wings that, to me (Fowler) gave the impression of a juvenile Ruddy Turnstone. The eyering was more distinct and it had dark lores, white forehead and malar which gave it a paler facial impression, especially when looking at it head-on. What a cool bird to drive right up to and get to enjoy from super close to distant looks of and fully experience and not just see briefly and hope for better looks.   I'd recommend birders chasing this bird to start at the parking area for the narrows and spend time really looking in between the coordinates above and then going to Teal Point to look from there.",Tringa nebularia,comgre,Species,6116,,4.89,61,,1518,2277

Primary bases and especially the tail appear slightly warmer than the upperparts. The flanks, especially the lower part show, some brown tones like C.m. minimus. P8 is longer than P7 in the folded wing, which is not a match for Bicknell's. Pale base to the mandible pushes past the nostril like C.m. minimus. The earliest arrival of Bicknell's Thrush to New England as stated on Birds of North America (Online) is May 15, so migration timing also favours Gray-cheeked. Wing ratio (length of primary extension past tertials to the length of the exposed tertials) in one image was ever so slightly below 1:1, but two other images resulted in ratios above 1:1, so suggestive of Gray-cheeked. Seems a good fit for C.m. minimus that breeds in Quebec and Newfoundland.  Mark Dennis' Comments: Found by Ronnie d'Entremont.

Black mantle (darker than GBBG), clean white head/neck and undersides, red orbital ring, greenish-yellow legs, and bright yellow bill with red spot. Wingtips entirely black other than small white spot on outermost primary, and some (worn) tiny white tips to the primaries. Much larger and beefier than LBBG and with shorter primaries.  Standing around (25.9357593, -97.3837033) right up on top of the dump, and mixed in with the Laughing Gulls. Never standing very close to any of the Herrings.   To access landfill get in line with the trucks. Do not enter scales until the truck before you exits. Pull on scales, exit car, and tell office staff you are birding. Sign in, and sign out on your way out. Closed Sundays. Open 7-330 other days. Closed if muddy. Follow all instructions from office and security staff.  6th record for Texas and 1st for the RGV. Probably ~20 records for the entire ABA. Amar Ayyash put together this summary of Kelp Gull records from Texas:  1-Galveston County, 15 January - 05 April 1996. Adult following southern hemisphere molt regimen.   2-Kleberg County, 04 May 1996. Adult type, no p10 mirror.  3-Galveston County, 30 November - 21 April 1997. Presumed to be same individual from 1996.  4-Brazoria County, 08 November - 24 December 2008. Adult type in active flight feather molt with new p1-p2/p3, with remaining primaries and all secondaries old. Small, broken, p10 mirror.   5-Brazoria County, 19 December 2008. 1st cycle. To date, this is the most convincing 1st cycle record in the ABA area. No obvious features point away from a pure Kelp Gull. Also noteworthy is that an adult Kelp Gull was at this site on this date.  6-Cameron County, 20 April 2022. The abraded tips to the outer primaries are what you'd expect on a mid- summer gull from the northern hemisphere. So it is indeed in line with what many adult Kelps would look like in the austral summer (just ended in central/southern South America). This appearance seems most similar to birds from southern Brazil and Argentina (definitely not Australia/New Zealand where many adults are finishing up outer p-molt). Structurally, the longer bill and longer leg look are unlike the short-legged, stout bill of austrinus around Antarctica. It's impossible to know, but my guess is this one could have failed to breed, molted primaries somewhat early... earlier than a typical Kelp in S. America.",Larus dominicanus,kelgul,Species,6490,,4.83,86,,2607,3911

Quickly noticed the salmon-pink belly and promptly freaked out. It flew off for a few nerve-wracking minutes, but returned and gave absolutely incredible views.   Medium-sized flycatcher with dark gray head, silvery mantle and wings, salmon belly and undertail, and noticeable solid black tail. More elongated than Eastern Phoebe, and slightly larger (had a few direct comparisons as the two species would sometimes squabble). The bird would perch prominently and sally out after bugs, often flying high into the air to pursuit. It occasionally wagged its tail, but not as frequently as Eastern Phoebe and in a much stiffer, pipit-like way. Sometimes landed in the road after bugs.   Bird mostly preferred the hayfield on the right (if facing the dead end) of the road, perching mostly on the fence but sometimes in the pecan trees. Please note that the road is a state road, so public property, but there are houses and farms nearby.

Four of those seven records come from South Beach, immediately adjacent and connected to South Monomoy (it’s all one land mass now). Another record comes from Morris Island just last year in August 2017, found by Sue Finnegan and John Pratt.  Originally MRW and SMW detected a small, lone, sleeping shorebird with a noticeably orange nape. The size of the bird narrowed the identification down to a peep, and the color of the nape seemed to rule out Semipalmated, Western, and Least Sandpipers. We conjectured that the bird might be a stint, and so further investigation was warranted. We cautiously approached the shorebird flock to within 20 m, and angled ourselves slightly to the side of the flock. From this angle we were able to view the scapulars, coverts, and tertials, most of which were black-centered and edged with an intense rufous. At this point, we were confident that the sleeping sandpiper was a Little Stint. We abandoned our scopes and encroached further on the flock to document this sighting with photographs. We gingerly inched toward the flock on our bellies so as to not disturb the birds from their respite. We halted once we were within a comfortable distance, and eventually the bird untucked its bill. The cheeks were a smooth buffy orange and bordered by a clean white throat and supercilium. The supercilium was broken into two neat lines that were divided by an orange wedge reaching down and anterior from the rear of the crown. The crown was a dark orange with many black flecks. The forehead was white and the lores were a darker, more intense orange. The breast was washed a pale buffy orange with brown stipples. The bill was relatively short and thin with a slight decurve. The base of the lower mandible was pushed noticeably more anterior than the upper mandible, giving an impression of a “notched” gape. This feature is characteristic of Little and Red-necked Stints, whereas Semipalmated and Western Sandpipers have a “flattened” gape. (Thank you, Suzanne Sullivan, for pointing out this useful field mark just three days prior, and thanks to Blair Nikula too for a recent discussion on stint ID). Finally, as the bird walked away, the legs were black and there was no sign of palmation between the base of the toes.  In brief, we arrived at the identification of Little Stint by ruling out North American peeps due to the extensive orange and rufous coloration on the face and back, and Red-necked Stint was ruled out due to the clean white throat, split supercilium, and rufous-edged median coverts.   We observed the bird for over an hour, from 14:55 to 16:10. High tide was at 15:20. The bird slept mostly, but stood up to preen on several occasions. The bright rufous on the head and mantle stood out like a sore thumb amongst the dark browns and grays of the nearby Semipalmated Sandpipers. Even from a distance of ~35 m, the bright coloration of the stint could be picked out easily with 10x binoculars. At times the bird was isolated from other shorebirds by up to two feet, although when other shorebirds moved around and that distance increased, the stint quickly surrounded itself again with Semipalmated Sandpipers.",Calidris minuta,litsti,Species,6181,,5.00,38,,1589,2384

The bird had a clean white collar that extended around the hindneck and distinct black spurs on the sides of the upper breast. The head was well patterned, with a distinct black feathering behind the eye, a complete black eyeline almost as thick as the bill, a black forecrown bar which contrasted with the overall white face and eyebrow and an obvious orangish-rufous crown that extended to the white collar on the hindneck. The rufous-orange crown was visible at all angles and contrasted with the sandy brown back. The rufous-orange crown seemed most vibrant above the white collar, eyebrow, and forecrown, and became slightly less vibrant closer to the top of the head. The legs were dark. The feathering around the lores on the right side of the bird appeared wet and slightly disheveled giving the appearance of an even wider dark lores. The feathering on the left side of the face appeared normal.  In flight, the plover showed overall sandy brown wings and back, with a slightly darker tail and white outer tail feathers. The bird had white bases to the flight feathers that was narrow in the secondaries and larger in the inner primaries giving the bird a distinctive, nearly complete white bar across the upperwing.  After the plover flushed silently the first time, I observed it from a distance, and I did not approach as it seemed slightly unsettled in the location it landed. After a few minutes the plover flushed, and it gave three calls as it flew back behind me closer to its original position. The three calls were a clear (not buzzy or raspy) “dip...dip...dip,"" somewhat reminiscent of a Sanderling.  The black upper breast spurs (incomplete breast band), white collar on the hind neck, and rufous-orange crown eliminate most similar looking Charadrius plovers and leave four candidate species: White-faced Plover C. dealbatus Swinhoe, 1870, Malaysian Plover C. peronii Schlegel, 1865, Kentish Plover C. alexandrinus Linnaeus, 1758, and Snowy Plover C. nivosus (Cassin, 1858).   The Malaysian Plover is non-migratory and unlikely to be found north of SE Asia and the Philippines, but the uniform sandy brown back from the white collar to the tail is inconsistent with this species which shows pales fringes to mantle feathers and a black collar below the white collar on the hind neck. The White-faced Plover is a migratory plover breeding in China and wintering in SE Asia that would not show the thick distinct black eyeline, bold and thick black forecrown, bold black upper-breast spur, and black ear-patch that are present on the Shemya plover. All those features would be absent or subdued in White-faced Plovers (Kennerly et al. 2008).  The final two species, Kentish and Snowy Plover, are closely related and were lumped by the American Ornithological Society in 1944 and then re-split in the fifty second supplement of the Check-List of North American Birds based on recommendations from Küpper et al. 2009. The Snowy Plover is the New World counterpart of Kentish Plover and has previously occurred in Alaska (Gibson et al. 2023). While plumage features can overlap between Snowy and Kentish Plovers (Oberholser 1922), the extensiveness and vibrancy of the rufous-orange crown and thickness of the black eyeline on alternate plumaged male Kentish Plovers can separate them. Adult male Snowy Plovers can show a rufous-orange wash to the crown at the beginning of the breeding season (e.g., ML226918741, ML221007011, ML92937001, ML52080491, ML247521021, ML432962191) but it is never as vibrant and extensive as breeding male Kentish Plovers or the Shemya plover. Adult male Snowy Plovers can show an eyeline/partial eyeline (e.g.,  ML451368811, ML221007061), but it is never as uniform, straight, and completely black as on adult male Kentish Plovers or the Shemya plover. Both of these features (crown and lores color) on the Shemya plover are consistent with Kentish Plover and outside the extremes of the Snowy Plover.  The wind conditions leading up to the sighting were favorable for Asiatic vagrants. Beginning on May 26, SW winds from Northern Honshu and Hokkaido, Japan began blowing NE through the Kuril Islands and to the east of the Kamchatka Peninsula. These SW winds continued for 24 hours through May 27 off the eastern shore of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Shemya Island continued to experience SW winds through May 28, but winds shifted to S just south of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Winds shifted to the SE on Shemya and the Kamchatka Peninsula on May 29; the day the plover was discovered on Shemya.  The Shemya plover’s plumage characteristics all point towards its identity of an adult male Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nihonensis). The extensive and vibrant rufous-orange cap and thick black eyeline are not seen in any of the similar looking Charadrius plovers. While Oberholser (1922) believed there was too much overlap in plumage characteristics (rufous-orange crown and dark lores) to separate Kentish and Snowy Plovers, the Shemya plover is an extreme example that shows characteristics inconsistent with any Snowy Plover. The vocalizations are also consistent with Kentish Plover. Its location in the Western Aleutians and the prevalent SW winds leading up to the discovery also support a bird of Asian origin.",Anarhynchus alexandrinus,kenplo1,Species,5920,,4.85,72,,1322,2204

After a few minutes the bird took flight and dove into the wetland in the SW quadrant. We stared at the marsh for a little while before I noticed it flush from the SW quadrant, only to touch back down in the SW quadrant. We saw it perched in the SW for ~15 minutes as it stood and periodically fed. We noticed it became alert all of a sudden - standing tall, neck outstretched - it then took off again, landing back in the NE quadrant where we had originally observed it (this was at 7:00am when it flew). Between 7:00am and ~9:45am I watched it as it fed around the outside edges of the NE quadrant pond. Often it would disappear into the grasses or go around a hidden corner of the pond only to reappear sometime later. At 9:45am while watching the bird with a group of people, the bird took off and flew over to the SW quadrant. The last I saw it was at 9:45am.  Photos taken in the NE quadrant.   Heard calling numerous times when it was flying around in the early morning.  *Never did we flush the bird, we made sure to carefully watch it's behaviour and feeding patterns, we acted accordingly in order to get close*",Tringa glareola,woosan,Species,6101,,4.81,89,,1533,2300

Thank you to Alan, who upon hearing it himself, insisted we had to get closer. With infinite patience we got so close to this invisible skulker, I feared that taking another step might crush him. Until this fellow popped out like a mouse or a winter wren, just a few feet away for a few seconds, I had no idea that yellow rails either create tunnels beneath the sedge mat or use tunnels created by small mammals.  He took one look at us and disappeared.  We retreated, appreciating the great honor bestowed upon us—a sighting in broad daylight.   Let Alan’s  words take over:  Hearing yellow rails on territory can be done.  Seeing a yellow rail is a bit of a feat.  But photographing a free yellow rail is an experience onto itself.   Maggie has ears with an exceptionally long reach.  ""Stop,"" she says.  “I hear a yellow rail clicking.""                   ""I can't hear it.""                                                                      ""It's out there.  Get out of the car and you will.""                  I did.  ""Wow!  How far out do you think it is? ""    ""Oh, where that sedge wren and swamp sparrow are singing.""               “I don’t care if the grass is crawling with ticks.  Let's put on our Neos.  Maybe we'll get close enough to see it.“  I didn't bother to take my camera.  Who photographs a calling yellow rail?  Well, it turned out that the bird kept calling from beneath a mixed matting of emerging spring grass and last year's prostrate sedge.  At times it was practically next to our feet.  How could I resist?  I went back to the car for my camera.   I know a thing or two about yellow rails:  Over a span of 47 years, I’ve actually seen them as breeders (Michigan), as migrants (New Jersey and Ontario) and as winter birds (Texas and Florida).   I preset the camera.  “If we see this bird, it’s not going to give much of a chance for a shot. “  Patience is a virtue: we stood stark still, maybe for an hour and went painfully numb from our feet up to our knees.   (We're not spring chickens.)   The photos testify that the endured pain was more than worth it.",Coturnicops noveboracensis,yelrai,Species,5597,,4.77,139,,2846,3985

But whenever any other bird like prinias or cisticolas or paddyfield warblers were entering its zone, instantly it was chasing them and flushing them out. As the prinias and cisticolas usually perch in the open, the bbrw was climbing up along these rigid sticks for upto 5 to 6 feet, then scouting the area for any foes and then jumping after them. So that moment was perfect to get it out on a single stick. I got some good views after spending an hour and half at the location.",Acrocephalus bistrigiceps,bbrwar1,Species,23242,,4.92,48,,1080,1920

Around 12 I was out fishing and luckily had my binos. I ended up flushing the bird and it flew over. What immediately stuck out was the the black spots on the belly and breast, the stocky build, and longish stout bill. At that point I had only seen it naked eye and from behind so I wasn't totally sure what it was. In fact I told the field crew that I had just seen something I don't think I hd ever seen before. So, I actually ended up changing the afternoon schedule so we could work while searching the less visited parts of the island for the bird. We started with an ISS survey around the NE part of the island and were not successful at relocated it (this is where I originally flushed it from). So we continued our survey south and came across pockets of birds but, not the bird I had seen. After ending out survey in the usual spot we rounded the corner of the Western Head and actually flushed the Great Knot with 3 Ruddy Turnstones. I got everyone on the bird and when it landed I moved in for a closer look. It wasn't until I was within 30-40 meters that I realized that the bird was a Great Knot! At that point I got some more photos and when it flew I attempted a recording on my iPhone. Not sure how well that came out yet. Another 1st state record for the island and in breeding plumage!  <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/scolopax/28468608866/in/dateposted-public/"" title=""Great Knot""><img src=""https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7629/28468608866_ccba5e2b81_b.jpg"" alt=""Great Knot"" /></a>",Calidris tenuirostris,grekno,Species,6129,,4.82,73,,1528,2547

I was sitting down listening and looking for SNBU when Chris DiPiazza came in and immediately started photographing something on the opposite side of the pier. That something turned out to be a PUSA, which had taken advantage of the very low tide to forage on the rocks that are usually covered by water. Started out slightly shy but became incredibly confiding as they tend to be, coming within three feet of me at times. Was still around when I finally tore myself away at 1:30. I wonder when it flew in... I was at the pier by 7:50 and it definitely wasn't around then, and a fair number of birders came by in between then and when it first was spotted.

Started out slightly shy but became incredibly confiding as they tend to be, coming within three feet of me at times. Was still around when I finally tore myself away at 1:30. I wonder when it flew in... I was at the pier by 7:50 and it definitely wasn't around then, and a fair number of birders came by in between then and when it first was spotted.

Spotted in one of first flocks of morning by Jeremiah Trimble, on water near Cory’s and Great Shearwaters. On first sight, notable characteristics were small size (similar to Great), dark-headed appearance, and thin dusky bill—quite different from other Calonectris taxa (Cory’s/Scopoli’s). Took off and flew right in front of boat, showing same characteristics in flight as well dark underside of primaries, long thin wings, long tail, and flight style more similar to Great Shearwater: snappier wingbeats and less ponderous flight than Cory’s. Flew off to east and lost among other Shearwater groups, despite our attempts to chase. Not seen again during 5 more hours in the area looking through the thousands of birds. Previous accepted record is from 15 August 2004 in North Carolina—an additional previous report off of Maryland in 2006 has since been determined to not be this species. Three other potential reports off of North Carolina (2013) and Florida and Massachusetts (2021).  (NB note: CVSH coordinates 41.670066, -69.860951. Approx 4.5 miles due east of Chatham Light and 3.85 miles east of North Beach Island dunes.

More details in previous checklists. I am now leaning towards Gray-breasted Martin, based in large part on the fact that this bird has appeared smaller and shorter winged than Purple Martins tend to appear to me, and the plumage seems to fit one or more populations of Gray-breasted. Caribbean/Cuban/Sinaloan Martin perhaps still on the table though. More research and consultation needed. Was putting on a great show being absurdly cooperative at the SW corner of the lake when I arrived, and continued to do so for the next hour. Then it relocated over to between the Peninsula, Duck Island and LeFrak, and put on a nice show there in good light, as the sun actually hit the lake for a change. Last seen at 17:30, heading east towards LeFrak. Nobody was checking Lullwater or Boathouse, so perhaps it found a bunch of insects in one of those places.
